# Desktop Biofibers Spinning Machine v1.0.1

![Machine Overview](https://github.com/utilityresearchlab/desktop-biofibers-spinning/blob/main/hardware/images/machine-overview.png)

The Desktop Biofibers Spinning Machine is an open-source, modular machine for producing textile fibers from sustainable bio-based liquid solutions. It enables prototyping new types of sustainable fibers and exploring the design of sustainable smart textiles.

It supports spinning fibers from bio-based solutions, including ones that require heat during the spinning process. 

This repository contains all the design-related details and files to build the machine.

## High-level Specifications
- ~$600 for a machine (and even less if you reuse an old 3D printer like an Ender 3v2!)
- Heated Syringe Wrap
- 60 mL Syringe Volume (using the Open-Source Large Volume Extruder)
- Supports Luer Lock Nozzles/Tips
- Supports Heated Nozzle using a Luer Lock-to-M6 3D printer nozzle adapter
- Modular collector assemblies for applying different coatings to fibers

## Building a Biofibers Machine
![Machine Diagram with Printed Parts in Tan](https://github.com/utilityresearchlab/desktop-biofibers-spinning/blob/main/hardware/images/machine-full-assembly.png)

- [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E_2IHzlC_cG40hGRjpHroCwSM1nkIKEBkRHdSb38-pU/edit#gid=0)
- Download the repository
- 3D Print the parts as listed in the BoM. Unless otherwise noted in the BoM Description/Notes, all 3D printed parts should be printed using PLA, 20% infill, 0.2 mm Layer height. The default "quality" setting in Prusa Slicer for the MK3S+/mini+ should be sufficient. The printed parts are shown in the color tan in the diagram above.

- Download the [CAD Assembly for Fusion 360](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qh19Er5d5Sq22oTk4Mabvu63gKj0vlPQ?usp=sharing) for assembly guidance and connect with us on Discord (see info below)
- Follow the [Electronics Wiring Diagram](https://github.com/utilityresearchlab/desktop-biofibers-spinning/blob/main/hardware/electronics-assembly/biofibers-electronics-wiring-diagram-v1.0.1.jpg)  alongside the [RAMPS 1.4 Schematic](https://osoyoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Schematic-1.png)

## Using the Machine
- Please see our [research paper](https://utilityresearchlab.org/assets/research/desktop-biofibers-spinning/chi24-desktop-biofibers-spinning.pdf) for more details on the process. 
- It is highly recommended that you use a 3D printer host controller software like [Repetier Host](https://www.repetier.com/download-software/) to communicate with the machine.
- In your host controller software, set the baud rate to `250000`, and connect as you would a typical 3D printer.
- You can use g-code commands to set the temperature of the syringe heater and nozzle, as well as set the collector speed/direction. More details are in the paper linked above.

## Join Our Discord for Assembly Help and Collaborations
We're eager to help and collaborate ðŸ˜ƒ! If you would like to work with us on the machine, build one yourself, or explore bio-based material solutions for fiber spinning, join our Discord: [https://discord.gg/vDmk3t2FMX](https://discord.gg/vDmk3t2FMX). For all other inquires, please reach out to 
 reach out to [Dr. Michael Rivera](https://mikeriv.com) and the [Utility Research Lab](https://utilityresearchlab.org).
 
## Planned Updates
- Movable Z-Axis
- Software Tool for Machine Control (for now a 3D printer host controller works to send G-code commands)
- Custom Collector Shapes
- Assembly guides
